# Comparable interface in Java

Comparable interface is one of Java built-in interfaces that is found in the java.lang package and has only one method associated with it. 
This interface is important since it empowers the implementing class with the sorting service (i.e. it provides a good way of sorting objects on the basis of a single class field).<br>
Classes that implement it gain the ability to compare its objects based on a single instance variable and the power to have its objects sorted using the Arrays sort method.
